Example of this cases are severe accidents, organ transplant, etc. especially the extreme health conditions sush as Leukemia and bone marrow cancer, which affected individuals experience sudden high blood loss and need an urgent supply of blood and do not have it. With the help of our Blood Donation Data Sets, tracking and  monitoring the supply of donors will improve and help the supply chain stable. It’s to make sure that more patients get the blood they needed for blood transfusion as soon as possible which can reduce the mortality risk. 
With the rapid growth in the use of social networking sites around the world, there has been a continuous increase in the number of calls for blood donors, as seen by the number of posts on sites like Facebook and Twitter seeking blood donors. In practically every country, finding a blood donor is a difficult task.  Blood Donation Data Sets was able to provide the easiest way for the better transaction in terms of blood donation. It is possible to know the blood supply available as we have this data sets. It also encourage other organization to donate bloods. Thus, the Charity’s and foundations can innovate the use of technology throughout a transactions with the donors to fill the gap between ICT innovations and different organizations can be augmented by this project . The application system is a supply information platform  that can help people in need of blood donations. It also enables hospitals and blood banks to record and store data on people who wish to communicate, and also provides a centralized blood bank database. This serve as an acts of intermediary to manage information between blood demand and supplies. The main goal of application is to educate and the community about the benefits and importance of blood donation, Having a data sets that manage donor and recipient records, and have easy access to all blood and voluntary blood donation information and also to promote it. All type of information regarding the blood distribution is accessible at any hospitals and blood banks in which the data sets will provide the information  regarding to that.
## Problem Statement
The present-day situation regarding the information of blood donors is a paper-based system that is enduring lack of central data references, which results in a time-consuming process for retrieving data in addition to lack of security of data and human error which needs an alarming system to circumvent. One of the problems currently in hospitals or blood banks which is very serious is the lack of blood supply during an emergency situation. The crucial need to transfer blood requires proper management to determine which blood group is available. The second problem which arises and that has led to the design of this data sets which in turn leads to human errors is that the vital information about the blood grouping, donor availability, tracing the data is complicated and time-consuming when it is done manually. Moreover, this manual based information requires a lot of manpower, data is also not secure, in addition to that retrieval of data and production of reports are time-consuming.
